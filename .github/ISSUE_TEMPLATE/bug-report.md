Please respect the following template to report a new issue.

Before sending, search existing reports on open or closed issues.

Always use the latest app version.

**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of the error and how it can be reproduced.

**Expected behavior**

If it is an error without an error message: A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Error message**

If an unexpected error occurs, the error message is copied to the clipboard. Paste it here.
The error message will also appear in the program log in the app's installation directory (if write permissions are available for this directory) or in the diary.txt file in the project directory (see "Menu: Extra - Show diary path"). The diary.txt file must then be closed.

**Further information about the error**
In many cases, the error message is not enough to resolve the issue.
- Save the project ("Menu: File - Save project").
- Back up the files "errorlog_data.mat" (same location as diary.txt) and the two current project save files ".. - MAP.fig" and ".. - MAPDATA.mat" (in the project directory). Note: An existing errorlog_data.mat file will be overwritten each time a new error occurs.
- Send the file "errorlog_data.mat" to <akilth@web.de> with "MapLab3D x.x.x.x Bug Report Issue #xxxxx" in the subject line. If the file is too large, use a share link.
- Only upon request: Also send the two project save files.
